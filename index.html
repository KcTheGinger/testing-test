            My name is Kasey Hoagland. I was born and raised in Utah! 
            I've never actually been out of the state.
            I am taking the Neumont College of Computer Science, Web Dev Certificate program! I am hoping to use what I learn in a future Game Designing
            </p>

        <p>
            On this website I'll have a few pages for my interests, my favorite websites and, future plans. 
            <br> This is a way to show off what I've learned from Neumont. It is also a great way to practice for me!
            <br> I am just beginning coding so I need all the practice I can get!
