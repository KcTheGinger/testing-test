  <p>
    I have a few short term goals that I hope to achieve within a year or two.
    My long term goals are just ones that I want at any time in my life.
    I have had so many ideas and plans that I had to narrow it down so many times.
    I think the goals are very obtainable if I just focus.

    One of the short term goals is to complete the Neumont College of Computer Science, Web Dev Certificate course!
    Another one is build my own game, something simple yet fun or witha good story.
    Building my 1996 Subaru Impreza into a rallycross car is hopefully a short term goal as well!
    My biggest long term goal are to open my own Game Design studio, I've had this one for about 14 years now.
