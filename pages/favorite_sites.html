    They are mostly basic ones just because I usually split my time between web browsing and playing video games.
    I will give a brief explanation to why their ordered the way they are, after the list!
    I am hoping that the websites I build will be on someones top 5 as well!

    Youtube is my top website because I use it everyday to look up video game design, coding, car related things and, music! 
    RS25.com is a website about older subarus that has so much knowledge I need to get my dream car exactly where I want.
    Twitter is also a daily visit for me just because of mainly memes and the fact I have many other small game delvopers with amazing games!
    Trello is a new one for me but so far it has helped me keep track of everything needed to pass my classes and to help my game design stay on track!
    w3schools is another new one for me since starting Neumont, so far it has been an amazing tool for me.
